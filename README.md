# Random-and-Noise-Project
Computer Security attacks aim to compromise the main principles of 
computing systems: availability, authority, confidentiality, and 
integrity. These attacks deploy a wide variety of techniques that is 
difficult to detect as they mostly simulate normal traffic connections. 
However, using their collective behavior in terms of packet 
characteristic, port numbers, and protocols may provide a chance to 
detect these attacks with a certain probability. The objective of this 
project is to use tools and techniques provided in the Random Signals 
and Noise course to identify the stochastic traffic characteristics of 
these attacks and use them to identify the probability of an attack. The 
techniques used can be classified as machine learning techniques. 
The project will use a dataset which consists of a wide variety of 
intrusions simulated in a military network environment. It created an 
environment to acquire raw TCP/IP dump data for a network by 
simulating a typical US Air Force LAN
